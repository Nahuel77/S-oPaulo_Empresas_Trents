📄 Project: SP-Empresas-Trends

SP-Empresas-Trends is a full-stack application designed to collect, process, and analyze public data on the opening of new businesses in the city of São Paulo.
The system combines:

Scraping / automatic ingestion of public data (business registrations, economic activity, geolocation).

Data processing and cleaning (normalization, georeferencing, categorization by CNAE/sector).

Trend analysis and clustering of emerging sectors.

Python backend, with an API to serve processed data.

Modern frontend (dashboard) to visualize statistics: number of businesses per neighborhood, most active sectors, time evolution, density maps, dynamic charts.

Optional: use of NLP / Transformer models to generate automatic summaries of insights, executive reports, or change alerts.

Objective: to offer an updated, navigable, and analyzable view of the business landscape of São Paulo, ideal for market analysis, economic studies, entrepreneurs, investors, or urban policy planning.
